IMPORTANT: Edit train.prototxt to use your selected dataset and 
make sure the correct parts of the network are enabled by setting/adding
loss weights and blob learning rates. 

NOTE: The training templates include augmentation, during which an affine 
transformation is applied to a crop from the input immages.
